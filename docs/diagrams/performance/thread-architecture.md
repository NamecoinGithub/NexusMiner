## Thread Lifecycle

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Main
    participant Net as Network Thread
    participant W1 as Worker 1
    participant W2 as Worker 2

    Main->>Net: Start network I/O
    Main->>W1: Launch worker (CPU affinity set)
    Main->>W2: Launch worker (CPU affinity set)

    Net->>Main: Template received
    Main->>W1: New template signal
    Main->>W2: New template signal

    par Mining in parallel
        W1->>W1: Mining loop
        W2->>W2: Mining loop
    end

    W1->>Main: Solution found!
    Main->>Net: SUBMIT_BLOCK

    Net->>Main: BLOCK_ACCEPTED
    Main->>W1: Wait for next template
    Main->>W2: Wait for next template
```

## CPU Affinity & Threading Details

- **CPU affinity:** Workers can be pinned to specific cores
- **Hyper-threading:** E-core and HT thread filtering supported
- **Thread priority:** Mining workers run at elevated priority
- **Single-thread mode:** Prime mining can fall back to single-thread for debugging
- **GPU workers:** Hash workers can offload to CUDA/OpenCL devices
