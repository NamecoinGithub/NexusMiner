# Current Miner Architecture

This section documents the current NexusMiner architecture direction after the
session-container and stateless-mining refactor series.  It mirrors the
node-side documentation effort so the miner and node describe the same design
boundaries, ownership rules, and upgrade path.

## Design Principles

- **Authoritative session container** — `SessionManager::MinerSessionContainer`
  is the per-session source of truth for auth, reward binding, lane metadata,
  and crypto context.
- **Explicit ownership** — `Solo` may cache values for hot paths, but it must
  resync from `NodeSessionContext` before submit, reward, and packet-ingress
  decisions.
- **Reconnect-safe reward binding** — the original reward string and decoded
  32-byte reward hash travel together so reconnect and resync paths keep the
  same payout semantics.
- **Lock-scoped validation** — session consistency is validated while the
  session mutex is held, so diagnostics and guards see a coherent snapshot.
- **Architecture-independent bytes** — packet bytes, reward hashes, genesis
  hashes, and ChaCha20 inputs must not vary by host architecture.
- **First accepted block as the acceptance target** — roadmap and tests are
  organized around the remaining work needed to reach a first accepted mined
  block safely and repeatably.

## Current Architecture Direction

### 1. Authoritative session ownership

`SessionManager::MinerSessionContainer` stores the miner-side session identity:
remote/local endpoints, lane, auth state, session ID, Falcon identity,
ChaCha20 key material, reward binding, channel state, and keepalive metadata.
`NodeSessionContext` exposes that state as the session-facing API.

### 2. `Solo` is no longer the independent source of truth

`Solo` still keeps local cached fields such as `m_authenticated`,
`m_session_id`, and `m_reward_bound`, but the current direction is explicit:
those values are derivative.  `refresh_cached_session_state()` and
`resync_auth_from_session_context()` pull from the authoritative session
container before reward send, GET_BLOCK, submit, and packet-ingress handling.

### 3. Submit and reward flows share the same crypto/session picture

The same session container exposes the session ID, Falcon identity, genesis,
ChaCha20 session key, reward string, reward hash, and lane metadata used by the
reward-bind path and the submit path.  This prevents “config-time state” and
“submit-time state” from drifting apart.

### 4. Lock-scoped validation is the intended guardrail

`validate_miner_session()` and `build_miner_session_diagnostics()` run against a
single snapshot under the session mutex.  The miner should continue to evolve
around canonical validation helpers instead of growing more ad hoc checks.

### 5. The acceptance bar is a first accepted mined block

The roadmap is not complete until the miner can produce a first accepted mined
block with strong coverage for reconnect, reward persistence, ingress resync,
collision isolation, and cross-architecture serialization stability.
