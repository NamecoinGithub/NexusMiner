## Overview

The Falcon Quantum Tunnel Vector (QTV) is a Julia research primitive for
partitioning a Falcon-1024 private-key payload into four deterministic buckets,
swapping those buckets into a working vector through a seeded permutation, and
tracking the active bucket with an append-only epoch log.

This is a **lab model**, not a production cipher.  NexusMiner production code
continues to use a single Falcon authentication key pair through
`FalconSignatureWrapper`, with the repository defining:

- **Falcon-1024 public key:** 1793 bytes
- **Falcon-1024 private key:** 2305 bytes

The Julia prototype keeps those production sizes visible while experimenting
with a multi-bucket structure that can be used as a structural model for laser
quantum data encoding and post-quantum data-channel research.

## Model Summary

1. The 2305-byte Falcon-1024 private-key payload is partitioned into four
   near-equal slices: **577 + 576 + 576 + 576** bytes.
2. Each slice becomes an immutable `FalconBucket` with a SHA-512 integrity tag.
3. A seeded `MersenneTwister` generates a reproducible slot permutation so the
   same seed always yields the same bucket activation order.
4. The currently active bucket is encoded into the mutable working vector using
   **XOR + chained SHA-512 keystream**.
5. Each swap increments an epoch counter and appends a `(epoch, slot,
   bucket_id, tag)` record to the swap log.
6. `reconstruct_payload(qtv)` reassembles the original 2305-byte payload in its
   canonical bucket order.

## Laser quantum data encoding

The prototype now exposes a message-channel transform that reuses the active QTV
state as the laser tunnel seed material:

```julia
encoded = encode_laser_tunnel(data, qtv)
decoded = decode_laser_tunnel(encoded, qtv)  # XOR self-inverse on identical state
```

Encoding model:

1. Build a keystream by chaining SHA-512 blocks over the current `working_vector`
   plus the active bucket tag, epoch, slot, and bucket id.
2. XOR the message with that keystream for the exact message length.
3. Decode by re-running the identical call with the identical QTV state.

Because the keystream is derived from the mutable `working_vector`, the sender
and receiver must reproduce the same seeded bucket ordering and swap sequence.

## Why four buckets?

Four buckets are the smallest split that still gives meaningful segmentation for
Falcon-1024 key material:

- `2305 ÷ 4` yields near-equal segments with only one extra byte in the first
  slice.
- Moving to 8 or 16 buckets would produce much smaller payload fragments and
  reduce the usefulness of each bucket as a standalone research vector.
- Four slots remain easy to reason about when comparing Julia fixtures against a
  possible future C++ parity harness.

## Deterministic parity testing

The companion Julia tests use fixed seeds and fixed fixture payloads so the
research model is reproducible:

```bash
julia docs/current/node/riscv/JuliaProgrammingLanguage/tests/falcon_qtv_tests.jl
```

The first parity invariant is always:

```julia
reconstruct_payload(build_qtv(privkey)) == privkey
```

That proves the partition/reassembly path is lossless before any swap behavior
is evaluated.

The deterministic swap helper is:

```julia
random_swap_sequence!(qtv, n_swaps; seed = FIXED_SEED)
```

It uses `MersenneTwister(seed)` so both the permutation and the applied swap
sequence can be replayed for parity work.

## Invariants

| Invariant | Enforcement |
|----------|-------------|
| Bucket SHA-512 tags verify | `verify_bucket_integrity(qtv)` |
| Full round-trip fidelity | `reconstruct_payload(qtv) == original_privkey` |
| Deterministic from seed | `random_swap_sequence!` uses `MersenneTwister(seed)` |
| Monotonic epoch | Swap log epochs stay strictly increasing |
| XOR self-inverse | `decode_laser_tunnel == encode_laser_tunnel` on identical QTV state |

## Fixed parity fixture for C++ handoff

The repository now keeps one deterministic tuple for cross-language checks:

- `privkey_payload = fixture_privkey()`
- `seed = 0x1024fedc`
- `n_swaps = 6`
- `message = "laser-quantum-channel-v1"`

Recorded outputs:

- `swap_sequence = [3, 2, 2, 4, 3, 4]`
- `encoded = c37d6117c8bd0b6e0b78dc38be38abce4c83aadaefb4ace2`
- `working_vector_digest = 12e0da8666c205832efc2c9f1016a24b6535e6fbf51ab657c1c36cb3688dd7358e521efa3578b11934bc4019ae51bf9ef2560b9dffbc9c330d32b867b7024f0b`

The Julia test suite asserts those values, and the C++ parity executable
rebuilds the same bucket partitioning plus working-vector encoding path and
checks the final digest and encoded message byte-for-byte.

### Reproduction commands

```bash
julia docs/current/node/riscv/JuliaProgrammingLanguage/tests/falcon_qtv_tests.jl
cmake --preset release
cmake --build --preset release --target falcon_qtv_parity_test -j4
ctest --test-dir build/release -R '^(falcon_qtv_parity_test)$' --output-on-failure
```

## Benchmark snapshot

Measured locally on the GitHub runner for the fixed 24-byte message above with
20,000 iterations:

| Implementation | Command path | Average encode time |
|----------------|--------------|---------------------|
| Julia prototype | `encode_laser_tunnel(message, qtv)` | `21.5319 µs/op` |
| C++ parity harness | `build/release/src/protocol/falcon_qtv_parity_test` | `3.4331 µs/op` |

These values are fixture-driven research numbers, not production performance
claims, but they provide the requested baseline before any production C++
adoption.

## Key design decisions explained

| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| 4 buckets, not 8 or 16 | Falcon-1024's 2305-byte private key divides cleanly into four near-equal segments. |
| SHA-512 per-bucket tag | Keeps integrity checks aligned with the repo's existing Falcon-oriented SHA-512 usage. |
| XOR + SHA-512 chaining keystream | Fully invertible and deterministic for fixture-driven research. |
| Seeded `MersenneTwister` | Produces reproducible bucket permutations for parity tests. |
| Append-only swap log with epoch | Makes swap history auditable and monotonic. |
| Mutable QTV + immutable buckets | Bucket payloads stay read-only while the active slot and working vector evolve. |
| `reconstruct_payload` round-trip guard | Confirms zero data loss before testing any swap sequence. |

## Security framing

- This prototype does **not** replace NexusMiner's production Falcon handling.
- The XOR/chained-SHA-512 working-vector transform is a reversible research
  mechanism, not an authenticated encryption scheme.
- No private-key material from the production miner is read by this lab model;
  the test suite uses synthetic fixed fixtures only.
