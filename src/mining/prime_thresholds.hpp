/// @file prime_thresholds.hpp
/// @brief Single source of truth for the two sieve-side filter thresholds
///        used by both CPU and GPU prime-chain finders.
///
/// Background
/// ----------
/// The chain-finding pipeline applies two distinct filters that, prior to
/// this header, were both gated on the same numeric value (`slot_filter_min`
/// on CPU, `Cuda_sieve::m_min_chain_length` on GPU).  They are not the same
/// thing:
///
///   * **popcount window floor** — a cheap necessary-condition early-exit:
///     "does the next 4-byte (= 120 integer) sieve window contain enough
///     surviving prime candidates that a length-T Cunningham chain *could*
///     start here?"  This is a provably-tight lower bound: if the window
///     has fewer than T survivors, no length-T chain can fit, so we can
///     skip without any risk of dropping a winner.  Setting this stricter
///     than T is a CORRECTNESS regression — it can silently discard windows
///     that would have produced a real winning chain.
///
///   * **close_chain quality gate** — applied after a chain has been fully
///     assembled by the wheel walk: "did the assembled chain leave us at
///     least T sieve-survivor slots so a Fermat run of length T is even
///     mathematically possible?"  Again, the provably-correct lower bound
///     is T: a chain with exactly T survivors where every slot passes
///     Fermat IS a winner.  Setting this stricter than T (e.g.
///     T + slack) trades a small amount of correctness for fewer Fermat
///     tests; per project policy ("favor correctness over difficulty") we
///     do NOT take that trade here.
///
/// Both thresholds therefore equal T (= the per-session target Cunningham
/// chain length).  They are exposed as separately-named functions to make
/// the SSOT explicit and to force any future tuner to ask "which one am I
/// changing?" instead of bumping a shared `slot_filter_min` and breaking
/// both at once.  See the post-mortem on PR #672 / Stone 6.9.1 for the
/// regression that motivated this header.
///
/// Why this lives in `mining/`
/// ---------------------------
/// CPU `chain_sieve.cpp` (regular C++) and GPU `find_chain.cu` (CUDA) both
/// pull from this header so the two paths cannot drift.  The functions are
/// `constexpr` (and `__host__ __device__` under NVCC) so they collapse to
/// integer constants in both `__device__` code and host code.
