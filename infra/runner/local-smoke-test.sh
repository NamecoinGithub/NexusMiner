#
# Local validation script for src/gpu/** changes — no CUDA toolchain needed.
#
# Usage (from repo root):
#   bash infra/runner/local-smoke-test.sh
#
# What this does:
#   1. Configures the `gpu-host-stubs` preset (builds worker_hash.cpp
#      against a stub cuda_sk1024_hash; no nvcc / GPU required).
#   2. Builds the preset.
#   3. Runs the registered ctest suite (worker_hash_integration_test).
#
# This is the recommended LOCAL validation step whenever you touch:
#   src/gpu/src/gpu/worker_hash.cpp   — snapshot block, nonce aliasing
#   src/gpu/inc/gpu/worker_hash.hpp   — class layout / static_assert
#   src/gpu/src/gpu/cuda_hash/sk1024.h — kernel function contract
#
# Full GPU validation (with nvcc and a real device) requires pushing to
# a branch with the [self-hosted, linux, x64, gpu, cuda] runner online.
